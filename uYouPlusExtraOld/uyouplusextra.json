      "versionDescription": "# iOS/iPadOS Compatibility Warning for v16.42.3\r\nrunning this on iOS/iPadOS 16.0-present. Is not obviously recommended.\r\nYou’ll encounter:\r\n**Stage Manager not sized correctly** (this version of YouTube doesn’t even take advantage of the new iPadOS 16 software changes so it’s pretty obvious)\r\n**App Crashing randomly around the app** (even if qnblackcat/level3tjg fixed the crash issue, it still isn’t solved unless uYou itself actually supports iOS 16)\r\n**ui glitches** (similar to Stage Manager not being sized correctly you might encounter a few glitches in areas on the app from iOS/iPadOS 16)\r\n\r\n# Using v16.42.3 Warning\r\npeople on newer versions like YouTube v17.49.6 shouldn’t use this release of the uYouPlus Tweak or it will get corrupted! This version is meant to be for users who doesn’t plan on updating to prevent uYou 2.1 from causing problems from the newer versions of the YouTube App. This is mainly used uYou’s stability.\r\n\r\n# Feature Downsides (Caused or Outdated by YouTube v16.42.3)\r\n*there are downsides to what you can or you can not do in uYouPlusLegacy*\r\n**iSponsorBlock:** iSponsorBlock works fine but the only thing that doesn’t work is how aligned the segments are in fullscreen, they are aligned different once enabling in fullscreen, make sure to not use it in fullscreen if you want to see the segments aligned properly since this YouTube Version uses an old Video Player UI.\r\n**YouTube Shorts:** as of 2023 or later, YouTube Shorts on this version is obsolete. Why? it's because Shorts crashes a ton in this version and making a short in this version is a bad idea. Why? because making one is now very limiting compared to newer versions of the YouTube App. and also if you plan on watching Shorts in the normal video player in this version then you will not be able to see Title, Description, Icons & everything else except for the Channel & Comments.\r\n\r\n**Replace Previous and Next Buttons:** don’t think about trying to use this. You cannot change them to Rewind and Forward Buttons on this version of YouTube. Intended for newer versions only.\r\n\r\n# uYouPlusExtra Features\r\nuYouPlus but adds Additional Features that should’ve been added to the original uYouPlus which were probably denied.\r\n\r\n**arichorn/LowContrastMode:** This tweak helps remove the new contrasty looking UI that was first introducted way back in 2020 August/September.\r\n\r\n**arichorn/LowContrastModeColors:** This tweak is an add-on of LowContrastMode, for users who doesn’t use gray will get a set of colors to switch which changes and improves the UI Customization.\r\n\r\n**PoomSmart/YTNoUpgradeDialog:** Disables the Upgrade Dialog so you won’t be prompt to update the app.\r\n\r\n**PoomSmart/YouMute:** Mute/unmute videos in YouTube directly.\r\n\r\n# uYouPlusExtra Release Information\r\nLTS Current YouTube IPA: `v16.42.3`\r\nLTS Current uYou Version: `v2.1`\r\nLTS Current App Compatibility: ~~iOS/iPadOS 12.0-present~~ (this requires iOS/iPadOS 14.0-16.1.1 if wanting to use this verison of uYouPlus)\r\n<details>\r\n <summary>Previous Changes</summary>\r\n\r\n**LTS RELEASE F1+F2:** (October 30th 2022)\r\n- YTABConfig `1.4.3` (`v16.42.3` supported)\r\n\r\n**LTS RELEASE F3:** (November 2nd 2022)\r\n- Updated DontEatMyContent from `v1.0.2` to `v1.0.3`\r\n- improvements with Alderis App Compatibility.\r\n- dropped support for iOS 13 (doesn’t matter if this version of the app is compatible with iOS 12+13, it requires iOS 14.)\r\n\r\n**LTS RELEASE F4:** (November 11th 2022)\r\n- Redesigned YTDisableHighContrastUI to LowContrastMode\r\n- fixed a lot of issues with LowContrastModeExperimental!\r\n- A lot of code changed!\r\n\r\n**LTS RELEASE F5:** (November 17th 2022)\r\n- Updated YTABConfig to `v1.4.5-3` (adds alerts, localization improvements & more!)\r\n- Improved Disable Update Dialog Flags!
